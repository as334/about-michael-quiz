# Quiz - About Michael

## About
I made most of the actual code in about 20 minutes as Computer Science homework for my Y2 (grade 9) Computer Science class but I went a little further with the program and wrote some instructions and some documentation which can be found in my [INSTRUCTIONS.md](https://github.com/michael-bateman/about-michael-quiz/blob/master/INSTRUCTIONS.md)

Please refer to [INSTRUCTIONS.md](https://github.com/michael-bateman/about-michael-quiz/blob/master/INSTRUCTIONS.md) for "technical", "developmental" and "documentation" info.

## How to use
For those who might not have much experience using Git, please follow these simple instructions very closely.  If you do not want to download the code locally, you can [view it online](https://github.com/michael-bateman/about-michael-quiz/blob/master/INSTRUCTIONS.md#code)

Otherwise, follow this:
- Clone the repository
```bash
$ clone https://github.com/michael-bateman/about-michael-quiz.git
```
- Then enter the directory
```bash
$ cd about-michael-quiz
```
- Run the file
```bash
$ python quiz.py
```
There, it all works!
