# Quiz - About Michael

## About
I made this quiz in about 10 minutes with Python.  It is very simple to use.

## Future Developments
* Write out scores in `.txt` file.
* Possible customization of the program using a text edit file with questions and answers.

## Modules
Please note to run this program, you will need the following modules:
* [Sys](https://docs.python.org/2/library/sys.html) - This is used to exit the game.
* [Time](https://docs.python.org/2/library/time.html) - This is used at the beginning for a delay between when the title is seen and the instructions.


## How to use
For those who might not have much experience using Git, please follow these simple instructions very closely.
- Clone the repository
```bash
$ clone https://github.com/michael-bateman/about-michael-quiz.git
```
- Then enter the directory
```bash
